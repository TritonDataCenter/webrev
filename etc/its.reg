#
# This file constitutes an informal registry for information tracking
# systems.  Its intended use is to facilitate resolving references to
# multiple such systems in SCM-embedded comments.
#
# Systems are listed alphabetically by unique PREFIX.  No priority of
# reference should be inferred from this ordering.  Applications
# using this information should provide their own methods to prioritize
# systems of record.
#



#
# The following fields are valid for each information tracking system.
# Fields not designated as required are optional.
#
# PREFIX (required)
#
#     A unique, three-character abbreviation.  Please avoid generic
#   terms like "bug," and instead use something derivative of the name
#   or URL of the actual system.
#
# INFO
#
#     A URL for additional information about the system.  Should be the
#   home page, essentially.
#
# EXTERNAL_URL (required)
#
#     A URL to resolve reference to a unique key.  See NOTES below.
#
# INTERNAL_URL_domain
#
#     A URL that is valid only in the specified domain.  Arbitrarily many
#   INTERNAL_URLs may be provided.  Define only if different from EXTERNAL_URL
#   in specified domain.
#
# REGEX (required)
#
#     A regexp(5) to tokenize a valid, unique key.  See NOTES below.
#
# CONTACT
#
#     A valid e-mail address for support of the system.
#



#
# NOTES
#
# REGEX should use parenthesization via \(\) to provide one or more
# tokens to be substituted in *_URLs.  See regexp(5) for syntax.
#
# A REGEX for a particular system is required to match any unique keys
# that are valid for that system.  For the common case, where such a key
# is numeric, it may be matched by the REGEX entries for multiple systems.
# Resolution of such ambiguity may be accomplished through prioritization
# or use of PREFIX, and is left to individual applications.
